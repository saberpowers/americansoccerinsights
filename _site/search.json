The theme for this research contest is the open-ended concept of match-ups in soccer. All proposals should in some way address how a specific match-up in soccer can be analyzed using data. This may include touching on any of the following questions or any original questions dealing with match-ups:\n\nMethods to quantify individual player match-ups (ex. A winger against an opposing full-back)\nAnalyzing the efficiency of various formations or tactics against each other\nAnalyzing the efficiency of various pressing methods against different build-up approaches"
