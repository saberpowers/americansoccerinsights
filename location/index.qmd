We will not have a hotel block this year, but we hope to negotiate a group discount for a hotel downtown.

## Child and Family Care

[Kids Garden](https://kidsplaygarden.com/houston){target=_blank} (two miles from the DoubleTree in the Houston Medical Center) is a flexible learning center which offers drop-in childcare starting at $18/hour for non-members. Alternatively, [Destination Sitters](https://www.destinationsitters.com/){target=_blank} is an agency that offers prescreened, fully vetted childcare providers who travel to the customer's hotel, starting at $32/hour.
