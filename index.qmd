The ASI Summit at Rice University is a soccer analytics conference that brings together researchers and analysts from professional teams, media outlets and universities. The agenda strikes a balance between presentations from those doing private work and those doing public work, as well as students showcasing their projects.

The 2026 Summit will begin on the afternoon of Friday, January 30, and run all day Saturday, January 31.

**Our [call for proposals](call-for-proposals) is open until September 1.**

**Our [call for abstracts](call-for-abstracts) is open until October 1.**

The goals of the ASI Summit are:

1. to facilitate the exchange of ideas between leading thinkers in soccer analytics;
2. to bring together MLS and NWSL analytics staffers for face-to-face interactions;
3. to give students a platform on which to present their soccer analytics research;
4. and to promote the work of women in soccer analytics.
