The ASI Summit at Rice University is a soccer analytics conference that brings together researchers and analysts from professional teams, media outlets and universities. The agenda strikes a balance between presentations from those doing private work and those doing public work, as well as students showcasing their projects.

The goals of the ASI Summit are:

1. to facilitate the exchange of ideas between leading thinkers in soccer analytics;
2. to bring together MLS and NWSL analytics staffers for face-to-face interactions;
3. to give students a platform on which to present their soccer analytics research;
4. and to promote the work of women in soccer analytics.
