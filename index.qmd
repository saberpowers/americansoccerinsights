The ASI Summit is a soccer analytics conference that brings together researchers and analysts from professional teams, media outlets and universities. The agenda strikes a balance between presentations from those doing private work and those doing public work, as well as students showcasing their projects.

The 2025 ASI Summit, hosted by Rice University, will last a day and a half. We will begin on the afternoon of Friday, Jan 31, 2025, and run all day Saturday, Feb 1, 2025.

**Registration is [open](registration.qmd) through January 24.**

The goals of the ASI Summit are:

1. to facilitate the exchange of ideas between leading thinkers in soccer analytics;
2. to bring together MLS and NWSL analytics staffers for face-to-face interactions;
3. to give students a platform on which to present their soccer analytics research;
4. and to promote the work of women in soccer analytics.
