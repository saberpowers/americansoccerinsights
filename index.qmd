The ASI Summit at Rice University is a soccer analytics conference that brings together researchers and analysts from professional teams, media outlets and universities. The agenda strikes a balance between presentations from those doing private work and those doing public work, as well as students showcasing their projects.

The 2026 Summit will begin on the afternoon of Friday, January 30, and run all day Saturday, January 31.

The goals of the ASI Summit are:

1. to facilitate the exchange of ideas between leading thinkers in soccer analytics;
2. to build networks between analytics staffers from pro clubs across the Americas;
3. to give students a platform on which to present their soccer analytics research;
4. and to promote the work of women in soccer analytics.
